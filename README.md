[ivanbichan.github.io/color_shift/](https://ivanbichan.github.io/color_shift/)

The color changes when the "space" button is pressed. If you like a color, you can fix it and prevent it from changing by clicking on the image of the open lock. After that, the lock will close and prevent the color from changing.

After collecting a collection of 5 liked colors, these colors are saved in the URL. By copying the resulting URL, you can send it to a designer or another person.
